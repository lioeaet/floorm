## sense

- immutable declarative orm with parent instances autoupdate
- SPA UX with no loading states after initializing
- transparent app architecture with 3 elements: doors, ui, router

## blowin' in the wind

- oneOf(inst => inst.hasOwnProperty('stork') ? ormX : ormY)
- items in localstorage, progressive app
- optimize <PreloadLink /> loading
- live socket connection to instances instead endless rest
- TimeTraveling inside code (cancel actions simplify)
- necromantic spell for turning abstract code to both hooks and server-side db instances changes (the.doors)
