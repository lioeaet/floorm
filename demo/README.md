# react-norm/demo

`npm i && npm start`

## sense

- immutable declarative orm with parent instances autoupdate
- transparent app architecture with 3 elements: hotel, ui, router

## blowin' in the wind

- flat
- errors
- jest
- optimize
- normId->nesting
- items in localstorage, progressive app
- PreloadLink, SPA UX with no loading states after initializing
- live socket connection to instances instead endless rest
- TimeTraveling inside code (cancel actions simplify)
- necromantic spell for turning abstract code to both hooks and server-side db instances changes (the-doors)
